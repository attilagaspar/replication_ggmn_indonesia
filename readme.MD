This repository ony contains Stata source codes. The part of the raw data that I have collected myself or is public domain is available here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/3a6oyr6bnrmgji4ujdb4o/ACmmqLX7DrOwUjoyjMV9UdE?rlkey=jn8whl2b4vstjcg8p8wq2l9ld&st=cdeu3fkv&dl=0. 

Besides this, the paper uses Indonesian administrative data (Village Potential Surveys 1999-2018 and Population Censuses from 2000-2010) and the Indonesian Sub-National Growth and Governnace Database (https://www.ids.ac.uk/publications/the-indonesian-sub-national-growth-and-governance-dataset-documentation/)


Data generating scripts
code/DATA_GENERATION.do generates the analysis data sets from the raw data (data/raw/). Its outputs are
data/analysis00s.dta
data/analysis10s.dta

Analysis scripts
code/EMPIRICAL_EVIDENCE.do generates the tables and figures of the main paper and the appendix. To run these, one needs the analysis data sets generated by DATA_GENERATION.do. The analysis data sets are available upon request.

The package was finalized using Stata/MP 18 running under 64 bit Windows 11 Pro (24H2, build: 26100.4202) on a Lenovo L-Legion-08135 equipped with a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-12450H   2.00 GHz processor and 32 GB RAM. The submitted version of the paper was written using Stata 13 running an early 2014 MacBook Pro and Stata 14 running on a 2018 Dell Latitude 5420 running Windows 10 and Stata 14.
